# DebateAI

## Inspiration

Philosophical and political thought is often taught by putting famous thinkers from different points in history in conversation with each other. We've enjoyed learning in this style and wanted to make it easier for people to use LLMs to generate debates about all kinds of topics as an educational resource.

## What it does

Our code allows users to briefly specify a topic and descriptions of two debaters, and then it uses LLMs to generate a debate about that topic with the debaters following the specified descriptions. For instance, a user could request a debate between Karl Marx and Adam Smith about communism.

## How we built it

We used Python for the backend and the OpenAI API to query LLMs to generate the debates.

## Challenges we ran into

Getting the infrastructure set up to use the OpenAI API was a challenge, but we got it to work.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Overcoming the infrastructure hurdles and building a working project that does something cool!

## What we learned

We learned how to use LLM APIs and how to write Python code that augments and modifies the abilities of LLMs to perform specific tasks of interest (in this case, generating debates).

## What's next for DebateAI

We'd like to make it possible to generate debates with more than two interlocutors and add features that give the user more fine-grained control over the topic and arguments covered in the debate.
